## Suggested PR Regrouping

The current Draft PRs were split very narrowly, which makes review context harder
to follow. The following grouping is easier to maintain.

| Suggested new PR group | Include | Existing Draft PR handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform/Bookworm/RPi4-RPi5 compatibility | Bookworm install/path foundation + board/GPS UART profile | Combine #499 and #505, or expand #499 and close #505 |
| Camera usability | focus preview, camera gain, camera LCD preview | Keep #501 or expand it with camera-specific docs |
| Input devices | Bluetooth keyboard, USB HID key mapping, keyboard mapping docs | Use #506 as the base |
| Optional INDI mount integration | INDI mount process, install script, object sync, INDI keyboard mapping notes | Keep #503 |
| Integrated time sync | GPS/NTP/RTC/software PPS, helper service, status UI | Keep #504 |
| Network connectivity | AP/Client/AP+STA Wi-Fi modes, virtual AP services, STA band preference, configurable AP IP, AP security/password, optional AP+STA internet sharing, OS Wi-Fi profile import, scanned SSID selection, web/device network UI | New Draft PR needed |
| Locations catalog | GeoNames-based offline location catalog, country/region/district/city selector, coordinate prefill | New Draft PR needed |
| Web observing UI | red night theme, PWA/fullscreen app mode | New Draft PR needed |
| Korean localization | Korean locale and CJK language handling | Keep #500 separate because the locale file is large |

Documentation should travel with the feature PR that needs it. For example, INDI
docs belong with the INDI PR, and Time Sync docs belong with the Time Sync PR.

```

## `python/PiFinder/boot_config.py`

This is a new file.

### Added API

```python
def get_boot_config_path() -> Path:
    firmware_config = Path("/boot/firmware/config.txt")
    if firmware_config.exists():
        return firmware_config
    return Path("/boot/config.txt")
```

### Purpose

Some PiFinder code previously hard-coded `/boot/config.txt`. Raspberry Pi OS
Bookworm uses `/boot/firmware/config.txt` as the active boot config path, so
camera switching and camera type display could read or write the wrong file on
CM5 Bookworm.

### Behavior Change

- Prefer `/boot/firmware/config.txt` when it exists.
- Fall back to `/boot/config.txt` for legacy Raspberry Pi OS compatibility.
- Keep the OS path difference in one helper instead of duplicating it in UI and
  camera switching code.

## `python/PiFinder/switch_camera.py`

The camera overlay switching code was updated for the Bookworm boot config path
and the IMX462 overlay.

### Before

- Read and wrote `/boot/config.txt` directly.
- Internally rewrote `imx462` requests to `imx290`.
- Added `clock-frequency=74250000` only for `imx290`.

### After

- Uses `get_boot_config_path()` to find the active boot config file.
- Does not force `imx462` to `imx290`.
- Adds `clock-frequency=74250000` for both `imx290` and `imx462` when needed.
- Keeps the existing flow of commenting out old `dtoverlay=imx...` entries and
  enabling the selected overlay.
- Updates the `switch_boot()` docstring to describe the active boot config path
  and root requirement more accurately.

### Code-Level Change

```python
from PiFinder.boot_config import get_boot_config_path

boot_config_path = get_boot_config_path()
```

Before:

```python
with open("/boot/config.txt", "r") as boot_in:
```

After:

```python
with open(boot_config_path, "r") as boot_in:
```

Before:

```python
if cam_type == "imx462":
    cam_type = "imx290"
```

After:

```python
# imx462 is no longer forced to imx290
```

### Expected Effect

- On CM5 Bookworm, camera switching edits the actual `/boot/firmware/config.txt`.
- The dedicated `imx462.dtbo` overlay available in Bookworm firmware can be used
  directly.
- Older imx290-compatible setups and direct imx462 overlay setups are both
  supported.

## `python/PiFinder/ui/callbacks.py`

The camera type display callback was updated to read the Bookworm boot config
path, and callbacks were added for the runtime camera gain and GPS port menus.

### Before

- `get_camera_type()` opened `/boot/config.txt` directly.
- On CM5 Bookworm, UI camera information could disagree with the active boot
  config.

### After

- Uses `get_boot_config_path()`.
- Keeps the UI mapping from `imx290` to `imx462` for older installs that used
  the imx290-compatible overlay for IMX462 hardware.
- Reads the current runtime gain from `shared_state.last_image_metadata()` for
  the gain menu selection marker.
- Reads the active camera type's `CameraProfile.analog_gain` for the `Profile`
  gain label.
- Sends gain selections to the camera queue as `set_gain:<value>`.
- Sends `set_gain:profile` when the `Profile` item is selected.
- `update_gpsd_baud_rate()` now reads both `gps_baud_rate` and `gps_port`.
- GPS baud and port menu changes call
  `sys_utils.check_and_sync_gpsd_config(baud_rate, gps_port)`.
- `switch_language()` treats `ko` and `zh` as CJK languages and restarts
  PiFinder after the language change.

### Code-Level Change

```python
from PiFinder.boot_config import get_boot_config_path
```

```python
with open(get_boot_config_path(), "r") as boot_in:
    boot_lines = list(boot_in)
```

### Expected Effect

- Camera settings/status UI reads the active Bookworm boot config.
- Existing users of the imx290-compatible IMX462 setup still see the expected
  camera type.
- The gain menu checkmark reflects the runtime gain instead of the saved
  `camera_gain` config value.
- GPS port and baud changes update gpsd through the same callback.
- Selecting Korean restarts PiFinder with the CJK font needed for Hangul glyphs
  on the OLED.

## `python/PiFinder/sys_utils.py`

GPSD synchronization now checks both serial device and baud rate.

### Before

- `check_and_sync_gpsd_config(baud_rate)` only compared `/etc/default/gpsd`
  `GPSD_OPTIONS`.
- `update_gpsd_config(baud_rate)` only rewrote `GPSD_OPTIONS`.
- Port settings such as `DEVICES="/dev/ttyAMA1"` could not be changed from the UI.

### After

- Added a `DEFAULT_GPSD_DEVICE` fallback.
- Extended the API to `check_and_sync_gpsd_config(baud_rate, device=DEFAULT_GPSD_DEVICE)`.
- Compares both `DEVICES` and `GPSD_OPTIONS` in `/etc/default/gpsd`.
- Calls `update_gpsd_config(baud_rate, device)` when either value differs.
- `update_gpsd_config()` rewrites both `DEVICES=...` and `GPSD_OPTIONS=...`.
- Missing lines are added if needed.
- gpsd is restarted after writing the updated config, matching the previous flow.

### Expected Effect

- CM5 boards where the GPS UART appears as `/dev/ttyAMA2` can keep that setting
  through the UI.
- On PiFinder restart, `/etc/default/gpsd` is automatically synchronized to the
  selected port and baud rate.
- After the Pi4/Pi5 compatibility cleanup, the default config uses
  `gps_port: auto`; the `board_config` profile selects the board-specific
  default port.

### Added Bluetooth Keyboard Helpers

Added `bluetoothctl` wrappers and device parsing helpers for the Bluetooth
keyboard UI.

Main added functions:

```python
def list_bluetooth_devices() -> list[dict[str, Any]]
def scan_bluetooth_devices(scan_seconds: int = 12) -> list[dict[str, Any]]
def connect_bluetooth_device(address: str) -> str
def disconnect_bluetooth_device(address: str) -> str
def remove_bluetooth_device(address: str) -> str
def reconnect_bluetooth_keyboards() -> int
def auto_reconnect_bluetooth_keyboards(...) -> int
```

Implementation details:

- Runs `bluetoothctl` through `subprocess`.
- Cleans ANSI escapes and prompt text before parsing `Device <MAC> <name>` lines.
- Keeps scan stdout and also parses scan-response/name-change events such as
  `[CHG] Device <MAC> Name: ...` and `[CHG] Device <MAC> Alias: ...`.
- If the initial advertising entry only exposes a MAC-like name, the later scan
  response name is preferred when available.
- Calls `info <MAC>` for each device to read `paired`, `trusted`, `connected`,
  `blocked`, and `icon` state.
- During scan, runs `agent KeyboardDisplay`, `default-agent`, `pairable on`, and
  `scan on`.
- `reconnect_bluetooth_keyboards()` prefers paired devices that look like
  keyboards, and falls back to all paired devices when no keyboard-like device
  is identifiable.
- `auto_reconnect_bluetooth_keyboards()` retries several times after PiFinder
  startup so late Bluetooth controller/HID readiness is handled.
- Auto reconnect skips devices that are already connected and only attempts
  disconnected paired/trusted devices.

Expected effect:

- PiFinder UI can scan, connect, reconnect, disconnect, and remove Bluetooth
  keyboards.
- USB keyboards work without pairing through the same libinput input path, while
  Bluetooth keyboards use that path after pairing.
- After PiFinder service restart or OS reboot, paired/trusted Bluetooth keyboards
  are automatically reconnected when possible.

### Removed Hard-Coded Username/Home Paths

Some install/runtime paths assumed that the OS user was always `pifinder` and
that user data lived under `/home/pifinder/PiFinder_data`. To allow several
PiFinders on the same network, the code now supports device-specific OS
usernames and hostnames.

Changes:

- `BACKUP_PATH` is now based on `utils.data_dir / "PiFinder_backup.zip"`.
- WiFi mode switching calls `utils.pifinder_dir / "switch-*.sh"` instead of
  `/home/pifinder/PiFinder/switch-*.sh`.
- Backup source files are calculated from `utils.data_dir`.
- The software update script path is calculated from
  `utils.pifinder_dir / "pifinder_update.sh"`.
- The NixOS migration script path is also based on `utils.pifinder_dir`.

Expected effect:

- If the OS user is `scope-a` or `scope-b`, backup, restore, update, and WiFi
  mode switching follow that user's PiFinder installation.
- The hostname chosen during Raspberry Pi OS setup is preserved and can still be
  changed from the web Network page.

## `pifinder_paths.sh`, Install/Update/Migration Scripts

Added a shared helper, `pifinder_paths.sh`, and removed `/home/pifinder`
assumptions from the install/update shell scripts.

### Added Helper

```bash
PIFINDER_USER
PIFINDER_HOME
PIFINDER_REPO_DIR
PIFINDER_DATA_DIR
pifinder_render_config <template> <target>
pifinder_boot_config_path
```

### Changed Files

```text
pifinder_setup.sh
pifinder_update.sh
pifinder_post_update.sh
switch-ap.sh
switch-cli.sh
migration_source/v1.x.x.sh
migration_source/v2.1.0.sh
migration_source/v2.2.1.sh
migration_source/v2.2.2.sh
migration_source/v2.4.0.sh
migration_source/v2.6.0.sh
migrate_db.sql
```

Implementation details:

- `pifinder_setup.sh` refuses to run directly as root, so the repository is not
  accidentally cloned as root into the user's home directory.
- System-level actions still use `sudo` inside the script.
- The default repo path is `$HOME/PiFinder`; the default data path is
  `$HOME/PiFinder_data`.
- `pifinder_update.sh` and `pifinder_post_update.sh` derive the repo path from
  the script location.
- Migration scripts use `PIFINDER_REPO_DIR`, `PIFINDER_DATA_DIR`, and
  `PIFINDER_USER`.
- `switch-ap.sh` and `switch-cli.sh` update `wifi_status.txt` relative to their
  own script directory.
- Shared boot config detection prefers `/boot/firmware/config.txt` on Bookworm
  and falls back to `/boot/config.txt` on legacy systems.

Expected effect:

- A Raspberry Pi Imager install can use any desired OS username and hostname,
  instead of requiring `pifinder`.
- Multiple devices can use names such as `scope-a.local` and `scope-b.local` to
  reduce mDNS collisions.
- Update and migration scripts are no longer tied to `/home/pifinder`.

## `pi_config_files/*.service`, `pi_config_files/smb.conf`

Systemd and Samba files now act as install-time templates.

### Before

```text
User=pifinder
WorkingDirectory=/home/pifinder/PiFinder/python
guest account = pifinder
path=/home/pifinder/PiFinder_data
```

### After

```text
User=__PIFINDER_USER__
WorkingDirectory=__PIFINDER_REPO_DIR__/python
guest account = __PIFINDER_USER__
path=__PIFINDER_DATA_DIR__
```

`pifinder_render_config()` replaces placeholders with concrete values during
installation.

### Expected Effect

- systemd services run as the custom OS user.
- Samba shares the custom user's `PiFinder_data` directory.

## `python/PiFinder/api_extensions.py`, `python/views/tools.html`

Web/API behavior was adjusted so custom-user installs do not show or use stale
`pifinder` paths.

Changes:

- `/api/camera/debug` now uses `utils.debug_dump_dir` instead of a hard-coded
  `/home/pifinder/...` path.
- The Tools password-change text no longer names the fixed `pifinder` account;
  it refers to the current system user account.
- The Korean locale entry for that text was updated.

Expected effect:

- Debug frame API and password-change wording match the actual installed OS
  user.

## `python/PiFinder/main.py`

Startup gpsd synchronization now includes the GPS port.

### After

- Reads `gps_port` along with `gps_baud_rate`.
- Falls back to `sys_utils.DEFAULT_GPSD_DEVICE` when `gps_port` is missing.
- Calls `sys_utils.check_and_sync_gpsd_config(baud_rate, gps_port)`.
- Adds `ko` and `zh` to the allowed development/test `--lang` command-line
  values.

### Expected Effect

- The GPS port selected from the menu survives service restarts because gpsd is
  synchronized on startup.
- Korean UI can be started directly with a command such as
  `python -m PiFinder.main --lang ko`.

## `python/PiFinder/camera_interface.py`

The existing runtime `set_gain` command was extended.

### Before

- Only `set_gain:<integer>` was supported.
- Gain values were converted with `int()`.
- There was no command for returning to the camera profile's default gain.

### After

- Added `get_default_gain()`.
- Backends with `self.profile.analog_gain`, such as the Pi camera backend, return
  that value as the default gain.
- Backends without a profile use the current `self.gain` when available, or
  `1.0` as a fallback.
- Added support for `set_gain:profile`.
- Numeric gains are parsed with `float()` so non-integer values are possible.
- Console/log output uses `g` formatting so `30.0` is shown as `30`.

### Code-Level Change

```python
def get_default_gain(self) -> float:
    profile = getattr(self, "profile", None)
    if profile is not None and hasattr(profile, "analog_gain"):
        return float(profile.analog_gain)
    return float(getattr(self, "gain", 1.0))
```

```python
if gain_value == "profile":
    self.gain = self.get_default_gain()
else:
    self.gain = float(gain_value)
```

### Expected Effect

- PiFinder still starts with the original profile default gain.
- The current running camera gain changes only when the user selects a gain from
  the menu.
- Selecting `Profile` returns to the camera profile default, regardless of the
  saved `camera_gain` config value.

## `python/PiFinder/keyboard_interface.py`

Added a text keycode range so physical keyboard character input can travel
through the existing PiFinder keyboard queue.

Added API:

```python
TEXT_BASE = 1000

def text_key(char: str) -> int
def is_text_key(keycode: int) -> bool
def text_from_keycode(keycode: int) -> str
```

Expected effect:

- Alphabetic keyboard input can be represented without colliding with the
  existing number, `ALT_*`, or `LNG_*` keycodes.

## `python/PiFinder/keyboard_pi.py`

The libinput physical-keyboard mapping was expanded so USB and Bluetooth HID
keyboards can be used alongside the GPIO keypad.

### Before

- The libinput physical keyboard path handled only arrow keys, Enter, and a few
  keypad `+/-` keys.
- Number keys, keypad numbers, Space, Esc, Backspace, and long/alt shortcuts were
  not mapped.
- The old keypad `+/-` event-code mapping could be reversed relative to Linux
  input event codes.

### After

- Linux input key code constants were added at the top of the file.
- Added `self.physical_pressed` to track Alt/Ctrl/Shift modifier state.
- Added `self.physical_press_times`, `self.physical_last_repeat_times`,
  `self.physical_hold_sent`, and `self.physical_press_modifiers` to track real
  hold timing for USB/Bluetooth keyboards.
- Added `self.text_physical_key_mapping` so alphabet keys produce real text
  input.
- Added `self.physical_key_mapping` for normal USB/Bluetooth keyboard keys.
- Added `self.alt_physical_key_mapping` to map `Alt+key` combinations to
  PiFinder `ALT_*` input events.
- `self.long_physical_key_mapping` is now used by both real long press handling
  and compatibility `Shift/Ctrl+key` shortcuts.
- Holding `Left`, `Right`, or `Enter/KP Enter` for one second sends the matching
  long-key event and suppresses the normal release event.
- Holding `Up` or `Down` for one second repeats normal `UP/DOWN` events, matching
  the GPIO keypad behavior.
- `Alt+key` combinations take priority over long press handling. The modifier
  state from the initial press is preserved, so releasing `Alt` first still
  produces the intended `ALT_*` event.

Important mappings:

```text
Arrow keys          -> LEFT/UP/DOWN/RIGHT
Enter/KP Enter      -> SQUARE
Space               -> actual space text input
Esc                 -> LEFT
Backspace           -> MINUS/Delete
0-9 top row         -> number input
0-9 keypad          -> number input
= or KP+            -> PLUS
- or KP-            -> MINUS
a-z                 -> actual text input
Shift+a-z           -> uppercase text input
Alt+Arrow           -> ALT_LEFT/ALT_UP/ALT_DOWN/ALT_RIGHT
Alt+= or Alt+KP+    -> ALT_PLUS
Alt+- or Alt+KP-    -> ALT_MINUS
Alt+0               -> ALT_0
Alt+Enter           -> ALT_SQUARE
Hold Left/Right 1s  -> LNG_LEFT/LNG_RIGHT
Hold Enter 1s       -> LNG_SQUARE
Hold Up/Down 1s     -> repeated UP/DOWN
Shift/Ctrl+Arrow    -> LNG_* compatibility shortcut
Shift/Ctrl+Enter    -> LNG_SQUARE compatibility shortcut
```

The previous compact single-key shortcuts (`q/a/z`, `w/s/e/d/r/f/g`,
`i/j/k/l/m`) are not used in the USB/Bluetooth libinput path because they
conflict with real alphabetic input.

Expected effect:

- The default `keyboard_pi` backend can accept USB and Bluetooth keyboards
  without switching to the DISPLAY-dependent `keyboard_local.py` backend.
- GPIO keypad matrix scanning remains unchanged.
- Object search and name-entry screens can receive real alphabetic input
  without multi-tap conversion.
- USB/Bluetooth keyboards can trigger the marking menu, return-to-top, and
  recent-object actions by physically holding the key.

## `python/PiFinder/main.py`, `python/PiFinder/ui/base.py`, `python/PiFinder/ui/menu_manager.py`, `python/PiFinder/ui/textentry.py`

Added Bluetooth keyboard auto-reconnect and the path that carries alphabetic
keycodes into UI text entry.

Changes:

- Imports `threading`.
- Adds `start_bluetooth_keyboard_autoreconnect()`.
- In real Pi hardware mode, starts `sys_utils.auto_reconnect_bluetooth_keyboards()`
  in a daemon thread.
- The thread starts after PiFinder subprocesses are launched so it does not block
  startup UI display.
- The main loop checks `KeyboardInterface.is_text_key(keycode)` before the
  special-key branch.
- Text keycodes are converted back to characters with
  `KeyboardInterface.text_from_keycode(keycode)`.
- Added `MenuManager.key_text(char)` to forward text to the active UI module.
- Added the default `UIModule.key_text(char)` hook.
- `UITextEntry.key_text(char)` appends the received character directly to
  `current_text` and refreshes search results.

Expected effect:

- Alphabet keys from Bluetooth/USB keyboards enter actual text in PiFinder search
  and text-entry screens.
- The existing numeric keypad multi-tap input remains available.
- Paired/trusted Bluetooth keyboards are automatically reconnected after PiFinder
  starts.

## `python/PiFinder/displays.py`

The display layer was updated for CM5/Pi 5 SPI device numbering and SSD1351 OLED
stability.

### Before

- Display classes called `spi(device=0, port=0, bus_speed_hz=...)` directly.
- Display initialization could fail when `/dev/spidev0.0` did not exist.
- The SSD1351 default SPI speed was `40000000` Hz.

### After

- Added the `display_spi(bus_speed_hz)` helper.
- Checks `/dev/spidev0.0` and `/dev/spidev10.0`, using whichever exists first.
- Falls back to `port=0`, `device=0` when neither path is visible.
- Sets the SSD1351 default SPI speed to `32000000` Hz.
- Allows `DisplaySSD1351(bus_speed_hz=...)` so test tools can override speed.
- Routes `DisplaySSD1333`, `DisplayST7789_128`, and `DisplayST7789` through the
  same SPI helper.
- Adds `pathlib.Path` so the helper can test SPI device-node existence.

### Added Helper

```python
def display_spi(bus_speed_hz: int):
    for port, device in ((0, 0), (10, 0)):
        if Path(f"/dev/spidev{port}.{device}").exists():
            return spi(device=device, port=port, bus_speed_hz=bus_speed_hz)
    return spi(device=0, port=0, bus_speed_hz=bus_speed_hz)
```

### SSD1351 Change

Before:

```python
serial = spi(device=0, port=0, bus_speed_hz=40000000)
```

After:

```python
def __init__(self, bus_speed_hz=32000000):
    serial = display_spi(bus_speed_hz=bus_speed_hz)
```

### Expected Effect

- Displays initialize when CM5 exposes SPI as `/dev/spidev10.0`.
- The SSD1351 OLED uses 32MHz as the stable default instead of the problematic
  40MHz setting.
- Test scripts can compare SPI speeds by passing `bus_speed_hz`.

## Camera Gain Initialization

This item is not a final source change. It records a reviewed change that was
reverted so the current behavior matches the original source. In the final
working tree, `python/PiFinder/camera_pi.py` has no Git diff.

Final retained behavior:

- `CameraPI.__init__()` accepts only `exposure_time`, matching the original code.
- Initial gain comes from the camera profile's `analog_gain`, not from the
  `camera_gain` config value.
- For the IMX462 profile, the startup gain is `30.0`.
- Even if `/home/pifinder/PiFinder_data/config.json` and `default_config.json`
  contain `camera_gain: 20`, that value is not applied during initial Pi camera
  startup.
- Runtime commands such as `set_gain` remain available, but they do not change
  the startup gain.
- The existing `exp_save` flow that saves `camera_gain` is left unchanged.

Code shape kept identical to the original:

```python
def __init__(self, exposure_time) -> None:
```

```python
self.gain = self.profile.analog_gain
```

```python
camera_hardware = CameraPI(exposure_time)
```

With this decision, PiFinder's observation auto-exposure starts from the profile
gain, as in the original source.

## `python/PiFinder/ui/fonts.py`

Font selection was updated so Korean also uses a font with CJK glyph coverage.

### Before

- `sarasa-mono-sc-light-nerd-font+patched.ttf` was used only when
  `language == "zh"`.
- Adding a Korean locale alone could still leave Hangul glyphs unavailable in
  the default Roboto Mono font family.

### After

- Uses the Sarasa CJK font when `lang in ["ko", "zh"]`.
- Keeps the existing behavior of disabling the Pillow layout engine for CJK
  font rendering.
- The related source comments are in English.

### Expected Effect

- Korean menu text can render on the OLED when `ko` is selected.
- Existing Chinese font behavior is unchanged.

## `python/PiFinder/ui/menu_structure.py`

Added a camera gain menu immediately after the exposure menu, added a GPS port
menu under GPS settings, added a keyboard settings menu under Advanced, and
added Korean to the language menu.

### Added Language Menu Entry

```text
Settings > User Pref... > Language > Korean
```

Implementation:

- Added `Language: ko` to the gettext extraction markers.
- Added a Language menu item with `name: _("Korean")` and `value: "ko"`.
- Keyboard input behavior was not changed; USB/Bluetooth alphabet keys continue
  to enter Latin characters only.

Expected effect:

- Korean UI can be selected from the PiFinder device menu.
- After language selection, the callback restarts PiFinder so the Korean CJK
  font is loaded.

### Added Menu

```text
Camera Gain
```

Location:

- Immediately after `Camera Exp`
- Immediately before `WiFi Mode`

### Menu Behavior

- Uses the same `UITextMenu` single-select pattern as `Camera Exp`.
- Uses `label: camera_gain` so the Focus screen marking menu can jump directly
  to it.
- Does not use `config_option`.
- Displays selection state from `callbacks.get_camera_gain_selection`, based on
  the runtime camera gain rather than saved config.
- Sends the selected value to the camera process through `callbacks.set_gain`.

### Choices

```text
Profile
1x
2x
4x
8x
12x
15x
16x
20x
22x
24x
30x
```

The `Profile` item returns to the current camera profile's default gain. For
IMX462 this is displayed as `30x`.

### Added GPS Menu

```text
GPS Settings > GPS Port
```

Choices:

```text
ttyAMA1  -> /dev/ttyAMA1
ttyAMA2  -> /dev/ttyAMA2
serial0  -> /dev/serial0
ttyAMA0  -> /dev/ttyAMA0
ttyAMA10 -> /dev/ttyAMA10
ttyS0    -> /dev/ttyS0
ttyACM0  -> /dev/ttyACM0
ttyUSB0  -> /dev/ttyUSB0
```

`GPS Port` and `GPS Baud Rate` use the same post callback to update
`/etc/default/gpsd`.

### Added Keyboard Menu

```text
Settings > Advanced > Keyboard
```

Implementation:

- Imports `UIBluetoothKeyboard`.
- Uses `label: keyboard_settings`.
- On entry, reads the Bluetooth device list and exposes per-device actions.

Expected effect:

- Bluetooth keyboard connection is available from the Advanced settings menu.
- USB keyboards work through the same `keyboard_pi` input backend as soon as
  they are attached.

## `python/locale/ko/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`, `messages.mo`

Added a new gettext catalog for the Korean UI.

### Generation

- Extracted messages from the current Python source with Babel.
- Added Korean translations in `messages.po`.
- Compiled `messages.mo` with `pybabel compile -d python/locale -l ko`.

### Translation Policy

- Common astronomy terms were translated into Korean where natural, including
  galaxy, open cluster, globular cluster, nebula, dark nebula, planetary nebula,
  double star, seeing, transparency, polar alignment, and chart.
- Terms that are clearer as-is, such as `RA/DEC`, `DSO`, `SQM`, `Gain`,
  `Profile`, `T9`, `Multi-Tap`, catalog names, device names, and port names,
  remain in English.
- 380 of 712 extracted strings were translated, focused on the core PiFinder UI
  and menus. The remaining strings intentionally fall back to the English
  source text instead of rendering blank text.

### Expected Effect

- Selecting Korean displays the main PiFinder device UI in Korean.
- Untranslated strings remain readable in English.

## `python/PiFinder/ui/bluetooth_keyboard.py`

New UI module for Bluetooth keyboard pairing and connection.

### Menu Items

```text
Scan / Pair
Reconnect
Refresh
<cached or scanned Bluetooth devices>
```

Device prefixes:

```text
* connected device
+ paired device
- discovered/unpaired device
```

The list prioritizes the device name on the small OLED and does not append the
MAC address suffix. If no usable name is available, or the name itself is only a
MAC address, it falls back to a short label such as `Unknown 12:34`. The MAC
address is shown after selecting a device, on the action menu detail line as
`MAC ...12:34:56`.

### Device Action Menu

For a selected device, the UI offers:

```text
Pair+Connect or Pair Again
Connect
Disconnect
Remove
Cancel
```

### Pairing Behavior

- Starts `bluetoothctl` as a separate process.
- Sets `agent KeyboardDisplay`, `default-agent`, and `pairable on`, then runs
  `pair <MAC>`.
- Reads output in non-blocking mode and displays progress on the OLED.
- When output contains a passkey such as `Passkey: 123456`, the screen shows
  `Type 123456` so the user can enter it on the Bluetooth keyboard.
- Automatically sends `yes` for `Confirm passkey`, `Authorize service`, and
  `Accept pairing` prompts.
- After successful pairing, or when the device is already paired, sends
  `trust <MAC>` and `connect <MAC>`.
- Pressing Left cancels the pairing process and returns to the list.

Expected effect:

- Bluetooth keyboard pairing can be attempted from the PiFinder screen and
  keypad without an SSH terminal.
- After connection, the keyboard appears as `/dev/input/event*` and is handled
  through the `keyboard_pi.py` libinput mapping.

## `python/PiFinder/mountcontrol_indi.py`, INDI Mount Control

INDI mount control is optional. A basic PiFinder install continues to work
without it. The separate process starts only after the user installs the INDI
dependencies with `scripts/install_indi_mount.sh` and enables `mount_control`.

### Main Settings

```json
"mount_control": false,
"mount_control_indi_host": "localhost",
"mount_control_indi_port": 7624
```

### Behavior

- `main.py` checks `mount_control` and starts the `mountcontrol_indi.run()`
  process only when enabled.
- INDI server connection failures, missing PyIndi, and missing mount devices are
  recorded in the status file and console messages while the rest of PiFinder
  continues running.
- `mount_control_status.json` stores a compact status snapshot for logs, debug,
  and web inspection.
- The object details screen sends sync/goto/stop/manual-step commands through
  the mount queue.
- Shutdown sends a mount-control shutdown command first, then terminates the
  process if it does not exit.

### Web INDI Menu And LX200 OnStep Control

Added `python/views/indi_mount.html` and the `/indi` route in
`python/PiFinder/server.py`, making INDI a dedicated top-level web menu between
`Equipment` and `Tools`.

- The `INDI Web Manager` button opens port `8624` on the current PiFinder host.
- `Current INDI Driver State` reads LX200 OnStep connection mode,
  serial/network settings, location, UTC time, park state, and slew-rate state
  through `indi_getprop`.
- `LX200 OnStep Driver Connection` supports USB Serial and Network TCP. USB mode
  lists `/dev/serial/by-id`, `/dev/ttyUSB*`, and `/dev/ttyACM*` candidates;
  network mode can select an IP from the AP connected-device list or use manual
  host/IP entry.
- `Location and Time` uses the GPS/loaded location when PiFinder has a GPS lock,
  otherwise it uses the default PiFinder location. `Reload Current Values`
  refreshes both PiFinder and OnStep values, and the UTC field keeps ticking
  while the page is open.
- `Send Location and Time` does not trust a stale browser-supplied timestamp.
  The Flask route recalculates PiFinder system UTC when it receives the POST and
  sends that timestamp to OnStep.
- `Mount Control` adds Park/Unpark state display, At Home, Return Home, Park,
  Unpark, Set-Park, native OnStep 0-9 Slew Rate selection, and press-and-hold
  direction movement.
- Direction movement is handled through AJAX: pressing a button sends the motion
  command, and pointer up/cancel/leave sends stop.
- Red Night theme CSS now covers selects/dropdowns/tables so INDI controls do
  not flash white, and the Materialize select sizing was adjusted to reduce
  clipped option text.

## `python/PiFinder/gps_time_sync.py`, Integrated Time Sync

GPS, Chrony, PiFinder SNTP, RTC, and software PPS are managed as one Time Sync
feature. The master switch is `Off` by default; when enabled, chronyd is the
default Linux system-clock manager.

### Main Settings

```json
"time_sync_enabled": false,
"time_sync_source_mode": "chrony",
"time_sync_clock_manager": "chrony",
"chrony_time_sync": true,
"gps_time_sync": true,
"ntp_time_sync": false,
"ntp_server": "pool.ntp.org",
"software_pps": false,
"rtc_sync": false
```

### Behavior

- In the default `chrony` mode, PiFinder reads `chronyc tracking` and chronyd
  owns the Linux system clock.
- In `best` mode, PiFinder compares Chrony, GPS, and PiFinder SNTP candidates.
- PiFinder's built-in SNTP check is `Off` by default to avoid duplicating
  chronyd; it can be enabled as a fallback/check source.
- The main PiFinder process keeps normal user permissions. RTC writes and the
  explicit `Clock Manager = PiFinder` fallback system-clock mode are handled by
  the root `gps_time_sync_helper.py` service.
- The helper has separate dry-run and real-write modes, and it does not write
  the system clock in the default chrony configuration.
- Status UI is available at `Tools > Place & Time > Time Sync`.
- Settings UI is available at `Settings > Advanced > Time Sync`.

## Wi-Fi AP+STA Simultaneous Mode

The previous `Client` or `AP` single-mode selection was extended with `AP+STA`.
This mode keeps `wlan0` as the STA for internet access and updates while the
virtual `uap0` AP interface serves the PiFinder AP for phone/tablet control.

### Behavior

- Added `AP+STA` to the web `Tools > Network` page and the device
  `Settings > WiFi Mode` menu.
- `switch-apsta.sh` applies `/etc/dhcpcd.conf.apsta` and enables
  `pifinder_apsta_prepare`, `pifinder_apsta_monitor`, `dnsmasq`, and `hostapd`.
- `scripts/pifinder_apsta.sh prepare` creates `uap0` and assigns
  `10.10.10.1/24`.
- `scripts/pifinder_apsta.sh monitor` watches the STA channel. When it changes,
  it updates `hostapd.conf` `channel`/`hw_mode` and restarts `hostapd`.
- `switch-ap.sh` and `switch-cli.sh` stop the AP+STA monitor and remove `uap0`.
- Pi 4 and Pi 5 use the same layout: `uap0` is added on top of the default
  `wlan0` interface.

## Locations Catalog

Added a country/region/county-or-district/city selector to the web
`Locations > Add New Location` form so known coordinates can be used as defaults.

### Main Files

```text
python/PiFinder/data/location_catalog.json
python/PiFinder/location_catalog.py

python/views/locations.html
scripts/build_location_catalog.py

docs/mf_location_catalog_en.md
python/tests/test_location_catalog.py
```

### Behavior

- Generated an offline JSON catalog from GeoNames `cities5000`, `countryInfo`,
  `admin1CodesASCII`, and `admin2Codes`.
- Korea is augmented with the country-specific GeoNames `KR.zip` extract, so
  Seoul district/neighborhood selection is much more detailed.
- North Korea is excluded at build time by country code `KP`.
- The server exposes step-by-step APIs for countries, regions, districts, and
  places instead of sending the whole JSON catalog to the browser.
- Selecting a place fills the existing add-location form with name, latitude,
  longitude, altitude, error, and source defaults.
- Manual coordinate entry and DMS entry continue to work.
- `scripts/build_location_catalog.py` can regenerate the catalog from fresh
  GeoNames source files.

## Web UI Red Night Theme and PWA App Mode

A red night theme was added so the web UI is less disruptive during observing,
and PWA metadata was added so phones and tablets can launch the web UI from the
home screen like an app.

### Main Files

```text
python/PiFinder/server.py
python/views/base.html
python/views/css/style.css
python/views/js/init.js
python/views/manifest.webmanifest
python/views/service-worker.js
python/views/images/pwa-icon-192.png
python/views/images/pwa-icon-512.png
python/tests/test_web_theme_static.py
```

### Behavior

- The web UI offers `Gray` and `Red Night` themes.
- Theme choice is stored in browser `localStorage`, so each client device keeps
  its own preference.
- A `Fullscreen` button was added to the desktop and mobile menus so users can
  explicitly enter fullscreen mode.
- Because the Fullscreen API can exit fullscreen on navigation, internal menu
  navigation from fullscreen mode shows a `Resume Fullscreen` recovery button on
  the next page.
- Log page log-line colors remain the original level colors.
- The manifest uses `display: fullscreen`, while PiFinder's internal nav/footer
  stay visible.
- The service worker is a minimal pass-through worker with no caching, so live
  UI behavior is not changed.

## `default_config.json`

Added the default GPS port option.

```json
"gps_port": "auto"
```

The `auto` default resolves by board model: CM5/Pi5 use `/dev/ttyAMA2`, Pi4 uses
`/dev/ttyAMA3`, and other boards fall back to `/dev/ttyAMA1`.

## `python/PiFinder/ui/preview.py`

The Focus screen was changed so bright or near-saturated scenes do not appear
black or solid-colored. The Focus marking menu also gained a direct shortcut to
the gain menu.

### Root Cause

The existing Focus screen display stretch is tuned for dark night-sky frames. It
maps the measured background to black so faint stars stand out. That is useful
for astronomical frames, but in bright scenes the background itself can be very
high. The result can be a black preview or an already-clipped 8-bit frame with
no visible detail.

The raw camera frame was arriving correctly, so the fix changes only the display
path and does not change exposure or gain.

### Added Constant

```python
STRETCH_BRIGHT_BACKGROUND = 220.0
```

Meaning:

- If the focus detector's background estimate is at or above this value, treat
  the frame as a bright/saturated display case.
- In that case, skip the normal dark-sky stretch.

### `_apply_stretch()` Change

Bright backgrounds bypass the normal stretch.

```python
if black >= STRETCH_BRIGHT_BACKGROUND:
    return image_obj
```

This is display-only. It does not change focus measurement or camera settings.

### Added `_orient_camera_image()`

Applies the same orientation rules used by the normal camera image path to the
raw-derived display image.

Behavior:

- Prefer `camera_rotation` when configured.
- Otherwise rotate based on `screen_direction`, matching the existing camera
  loop behavior.

### Added `_raw_display_image()`

Builds a raw-derived display image for bright scenes.

Processing steps:

1. Read the latest raw array from `self.shared_state.cam_raw()`.
2. Return no fallback if the array is not two-dimensional.
3. Convert to `float32`.
4. Trim to even dimensions.
5. Average nominal Bayer 2x2 blocks.
6. Build an 8-bit display image using 1.0 and 99.5 percentiles.
7. If the two percentile values differ by 1 ADU or less, treat the frame as a
   saturated or nearly flat bright raw frame and display it as white.
8. Apply `_orient_camera_image()`.

Reason for 2x2 averaging:

- IMX462 is reported by the driver as an `SRGGB12`-style format, but the actual
  hardware can behave like a mono sensor.
- Averaging nominal 2x2 Bayer blocks reduces checker-pattern artifacts on mono
  hardware.
- This is display-only and does not alter solver or focus-measurement data.

Reason for the flat-bright raw case:

- In bright conditions, the raw frame can be almost fully saturated, making the
  1.0 and 99.5 percentiles equal.
- Stretching that with `high = low + 1` makes `(arr - low)` zero everywhere,
  which maps the whole Focus preview to black.
- The raw fallback is only used after the frame has already been classified as
  bright, so a no-span raw fallback should stay bright rather than turn black.

### `update()` Display Path Change

Previous path:

```text
camera_image copy -> resize_for_display -> _apply_stretch -> red mask -> screen
```

Bright-background path after the change:

```text
shared_state.cam_raw -> 2x2 average -> percentile stretch -> orientation
-> resize_for_display -> red mask -> screen
```

Dark observation frame path after the change:

```text
existing camera_image focus-stretch path is preserved
```

Actual branch behavior:

- Starts with `display_image = raw_image` and `stretch_display = True`.
- If `_stretch_black >= STRETCH_BRIGHT_BACKGROUND`, tries `_raw_display_image()`.
- If the raw fallback succeeds, replaces `display_image` with the raw-derived
  image and sets `stretch_display = False`.
- If the raw fallback is unavailable, the existing image is used, but
  `_apply_stretch()` still bypasses the dark-sky stretch for bright backgrounds.
- The common resize, `L` conversion, and red-mask display path is then used.

### Expected Effect

- Bright scenes no longer collapse to black in the Focus screen.
- Details can still be shown even when the already-processed 8-bit frame is
  clipped.
- Exposure and gain are not changed.
- Dark observation frames continue to use the existing focus-stretch behavior.
- From the Focus screen, the `Gain` shortcut opens the `Camera Gain` menu, matching
  the existing `Exposure` shortcut pattern.

## `scripts/camera_lcd_preview.py`

Added a hardware diagnostic tool for checking camera raw input and SSD1351 OLED
output separately from the full PiFinder service.

### Script Role

- This is a diagnostic script, not part of the normal PiFinder runtime path.
- It owns the camera and OLED directly, so it must not run at the same time as
  the PiFinder service.
- It is kept so camera/LCD/SPI behavior can be rechecked quickly later.

### Main Features

- Opens `Picamera2` directly and captures the raw stream.
- Uses `PiFinder.sqm.camera_profiles` to apply camera profile crop/rotation.
- Averages nominal Bayer 2x2 blocks to create a mono display image.
- Uses percentile stretch to create an 8-bit LCD frame.
- Supports temporal smoothing for display noise reduction.
- Lets SSD1351 SPI speed be selected with `--spi-hz`.
- Supports native auto-exposure with `--auto-exposure`.
- Saves the latest displayed frame to `/tmp/camera_lcd_preview_latest.png`.

### Implementation Details

- Adds `REPO_ROOT/python` to `sys.path` so the script can import the `PiFinder`
  package when launched directly.
- Calls `DisplaySSD1351(bus_speed_hz=args.spi_hz)` only for `--display ssd1351`,
  making SSD1351 SPI speed tests explicit.
- Configures Picamera2 with `create_still_configuration({"size": (512, 512)}, raw={"size": profile.raw_size, "format": profile.format})`.
- With auto exposure enabled it sets only `AeEnable=True`; otherwise it sets
  manual `AnalogueGain` and `ExposureTime`.
- Captures raw data with `request.make_array("raw").copy().view(np.uint16)` and
  uses request metadata for the exposure/gain overlay.
- Handles `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` so the camera is stopped and closed cleanly.
- Runs until `--duration` expires when it is greater than zero; `0` means run
  until stopped by the user.
- Creates the snapshot parent directory and saves the latest displayed frame at
  roughly one-second intervals.

### Important Options

### Final Recommended Command

```bash
sudo systemctl stop pifinder
cd /home/pifinder/PiFinder
python3 scripts/camera_lcd_preview.py \
  --display ssd1351 \
  --spi-hz 32000000 \
  --auto-exposure \
  --fps 4 \
  --brightness 255 \
  --denoise 0.82 \
  --min-contrast 512 \
  --snapshot /tmp/camera_lcd_preview_latest.png
```

### Return To PiFinder

```bash
sudo systemctl start pifinder
```

### Expected Effect

- Camera and LCD can be checked without going through PiFinder UI or solver.
- OLED SPI issues can be separated from camera input issues.
- The selected SSD1351 32MHz value can be revalidated later.

## Final Behavior Baseline

With the current source changes, PiFinder is expected to behave as follows:

- On Bookworm, PiFinder code prefers `/boot/firmware/config.txt`.
- On legacy systems, `/boot/config.txt` fallback remains available.
- Install/update scripts use the current OS user's `$HOME/PiFinder` and
  `$HOME/PiFinder_data` by default.
- systemd and Samba configs are rendered at install time with the actual OS user
  and home paths.
- Choosing a unique hostname during Raspberry Pi OS setup reduces
  `<hostname>.local` mDNS collisions.
- IMX462 is no longer forced to the imx290 overlay.
- SSD1351 OLED default SPI speed is `32MHz`.
- Display initialization can use `/dev/spidev10.0`.
- Initial Pi camera gain uses the camera profile's `analog_gain`, matching the
  original source.
- The `Camera Gain` menu can adjust runtime gain and return to the original
  profile default with `Profile`.
- `GPS Settings > GPS Port` can select the gpsd serial device.
- This CM5 unit currently uses `/dev/ttyAMA2` at `115200` baud for GPS.
- `Settings > Advanced > Keyboard` can scan for and connect Bluetooth keyboards.
- USB and Bluetooth keyboards are mapped into PiFinder input through the default
  `keyboard_pi` libinput path.
- Plain alphabet keys from USB/Bluetooth keyboards enter real text in search and
  text-entry screens.
- USB/Bluetooth keyboard `Alt` combinations produce `ALT_*` events.
- Holding USB/Bluetooth keyboard `Left`, `Right`, or `Enter/KP Enter` for one
  second produces long-key events.
- Holding USB/Bluetooth keyboard `Up` or `Down` for one second repeats normal
  `UP/DOWN` events.
- USB/Bluetooth keyboard `Shift` or `Ctrl` long-key shortcuts are retained for
  compatibility.
- Paired/trusted Bluetooth keyboards are automatically reconnected in the
  background when the PiFinder service starts.
- `Settings > User Pref... > Language` can select Korean.
- Korean UI uses the Sarasa CJK font, and PiFinder restarts immediately after
  the language change so the font is reloaded.
- Keyboard character input remains English alphabet input in Korean UI.
- Bright Focus screen frames use the raw-derived display fallback.
- Dark observation Focus screen frames keep the existing focus-stretch path.
- `scripts/camera_lcd_preview.py` provides isolated camera-to-LCD diagnostics.

## Pi4 Bookworm Compatibility Follow-Up

Raspberry Pi 4 Bookworm 64-bit hardware testing showed that the CM5 GPS default
port did not match Pi4, so GPS port selection now has a board-aware automatic
default.

- Changed the `default_config.json` `gps_port` default to `auto`.
- Added `python/PiFinder/board_config.py`, defining `pi5_class`, `pi4`, and
  `legacy` profiles for board-specific UART overlays and default GPS ports.
- `sys_utils.get_default_gpsd_device()` now resolves through the `board_config`
  profile: CM5/Pi5 use `/dev/ttyAMA2`, Pi4 uses `/dev/ttyAMA3`, and other
  boards use `/dev/ttyAMA1`.
- `pifinder_paths.sh` uses matching `pi5_class`/`pi4`/`legacy` helpers so install
  time UART overlays and gpsd `DEVICES` defaults follow the same model.
- Added `Auto` and `/dev/ttyAMA3` entries to `GPS Settings > GPS Port`.
- The setup script uses the same board detection when writing the initial
  `/etc/default/gpsd` `DEVICES` value.
- On the Pi4 test unit, gpsd identified the u-blox receiver on `/dev/ttyAMA3` at
  115200bps. Indoor testing still had no GPS fix, so outdoor antenna testing is
  still pending.
- Bookworm BlueZ did not accept `bluetoothctl paired-devices`, so Bluetooth
  listing now uses `bluetoothctl devices Paired`.
- The tested `K06 BLE Keyboard` stayed paired/trusted/connected but did not
  create a `/dev/input/event*` device with the default BlueZ input settings.
- Enabling `UserspaceHID=true` and `LEAutoSecurity=true` in
  `/etc/bluetooth/input.conf`, then restarting Bluetooth, created
  `/dev/input/event4`; `libinput debug-events` confirmed arrow-key input.
- The setup script now applies the same BlueZ input settings during new
  installs.
- Added `docs/mf_pifinder_rpi4_pi5_compatibility_ko.md` to summarize Pi4/Pi5/CM5
  profiles, install-time defaults, and verification steps in one place.
